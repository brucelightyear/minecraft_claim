> A powerful territory claiming system for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that automatically manages player gamemodes based on territory ownership.

---

A Minecraft Bedrock Edition script that implements a territory claiming system with automatic gamemode switching. Players can claim territories and receive creative mode privileges within their claimed areas while other players are restricted to adventure mode.

## üåç Available Languages

- üá¨üáß [English](README.md)
- üá´üá∑ [Fran√ßais](README.fr.md)

## Features

- Territory claiming using special claim blocks
- Automatic gamemode switching based on territory ownership:
  - Creative mode in your own territory
  - Adventure mode in others' territories
  - Survival mode in unclaimed areas
- Anti-overlap protection for claims
- Persistent storage of claims
- In-game commands for managing claims

## Commands

- `!claim_anchor` - Receive a claim block
- `!claims` - Display all current territory claims
- `!clear-claims` - Remove all claims (use with caution)

## How It Works

### Claiming Territory

1. Use the `!claim_anchor` command to get a claim block
2. Place the claim block to create a territory
3. A 100x100 area (50 blocks radius) will be claimed around the block
4. Claims cannot overlap with existing territories

### Territory Management

- Only the owner can break their claim block
- Claims are automatically saved and persist between server restarts
- The system continuously monitors player positions and updates gamemodes accordingly

### Gamemode Rules

Players will automatically switch between different gamemodes:
- **Creative Mode**: When in your own territory
- **Adventure Mode**: When in someone else's territory
- **Survival Mode**: When in unclaimed areas

## Technical Details

- Uses the Minecraft Bedrock Edition scripting API
- Implements persistent storage using dynamic properties
- Runs position checks every 2 seconds (40 ticks)
- Claims are stored as coordinates with owner information and radius
- Includes error handling and debugging messages

## Installation

1. Download both .mcpack files from the [latest release](https://github.com/brucelightyear/minecraft_claim/releases/tag/v1.0.12):
   - ClaimBlock_BP.mcpack (Behavior Pack)
   - ClaimBlock_RP.mcpack (Resource Pack)
2. Double-click each .mcpack file to automatically install them in Minecraft
3. Create a new world or edit an existing one and activate both packs in the world settings

## Dependencies

- Minecraft Bedrock Edition

## Language

The script includes French language messages. Update the messages in the code to change the language.

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling and will log errors to the console while attempting to maintain functionality.
